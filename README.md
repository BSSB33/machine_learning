# Introduction to Data Science subject at ELTE and the Machine Learning A-Z Hands-On Python repository
Welcome!
This Repository contains my codes and useful materials mainly from the followint courses:
- 'Introduction to Data Science' subject at ELTE
- 'Machine Learning A-Z Hands-On Python' online course from Udemy
- 'Machine Learning' subject at ELTE
The report from the university subject was graded to be 3/5 and 4/5, so please note that it is very far from being perfect. 
The reason for this is simple. This was my first Data Science project, so to create this working code and final report, I had to do a serious amount of research in both theoretical and practical parts.
Despite passing the subject at the university, I was very far from being satisfied so I decided to go through everything with better and more detailed explanations with the help of this Udemy course. (Python parts only) (`https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/`)

## Content:

### Introduction to Data Science subject at ELTE:
- Used code of Assignment in `.py` extension and other code snippets in the form of a Jupiter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Final report with used models and techniques with the task description. (`.pdf`) The Report Is available here [Intro Report](https://github.com/BSSB33/machine_learning/blob/main/Introduction%20To%20Data%20Science/Assignment/Final_Report.pdf)
- Other materials, charts generated.
- Class materials
- Lecure slides

### Machine Learning subject at ELTE:
- Used code of Assignment in `.py` extension and other code snippets in the form of a Jupiter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Final report with used models and techniques with the task description. (`.pdf`) The Report Is available here [ML Report](https://github.com/BSSB33/machine_learning/blob/main/Semester%20project%20-%20ML%20challenge/SUBMITTED/Machine_Learning_Assignment.pdf)
- Other materials, prediction results, example images.

### Data Science Lab:
This lab was spearated from this repository, but it can be found here: Link to the DSC-Lab repository [DSC-Lab Link](https://github.com/BSSB33/DSC-Lab/)  
The Paper/Report Is available here [Lab Report/Paper](https://github.com/BSSB33/DSC-Lab/blob/main/Data_Science_Lab___Paper_2021.pdf)

### Learning/Practice Materials
Additional data, class materials for Machine Learning:
- ELTE Software for Advanced Machine Learning (Class Materials + Assignment)
- ELTE Deep Neuron Networks Assignments (Only Resource)
- BME Machine Learning Practice Class Materials (Only Resource)
- ELTE Computer Networks Assignments - Fun Python Exercises with Sockets (Assignments)

Please note that the purpose of this repository is to make the theory and the codebase easily accessible and to show how I got better in this field. 2021_June.
