Dear Students,

The data set, related to customer credit risk, and the description of the attributes are uploaded in the Files.

There are three tasks for the semestral project, such that
1) Develop a prediction model to classify the customers as good or bad;
2) Cluster the customers into various groups;
3) Provide some ideas on how frequent pattern mining could be utilized to uncover some patterns in the data and/or to enhance the classification;

You have to write a report, in LaTEX, of 8 to 10 pages in Springer LNCS style about your work and the results achieved. The template for the project can be found at
https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines

You have to upload two files into Canvas, such that
1) The prepared report (in pdf), named [student's full name]-[Neptun Code].pdf;
2) The LaTEX source files (in a compressed archive), named [student's full name]-[Neptun Code].zip;
2) The related program source codes (in plain text), named [student's full name]-[Neptun Code].txt (in case of more source files, just copy-paste all into one text file).
Please, besides uploading these files into Canvas, send them by email to horvatha@inf.elte.hu as well.

The deadline for uploading the files (the report, the LaTEX and program source codes) is 11th of December 2020.

Best regards,
Tomas
